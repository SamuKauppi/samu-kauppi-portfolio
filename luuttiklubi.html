            This project was my second portfolio project that I made while studying in Metropolia. I was the lead
            coder/designer for this project and the students in Stadin AO provided the art assets for this game. The
            game was made for YLEâ€™s new gaming related streaming channel, Luuttiklubi. The idea was to create a point
            and click game that could be played on the stream. This project faced numerous challenges during
            development, leading to an unfinished game, but we invested significant effort into it and managed to create
            a base for a game that YLE can develop further.

            So, what went wrong and what can I learn from this project? When developing games as a team, it's crucial to
            maintain a clear project vision and adhere to a strict schedule. In this project we did a poor job on both,
            which resulted in every team member having their own idea on what kind of project we were making and how far
            we have developed it. In the end we had to cut a lot from the game to streamline it and we had no time to
            fix bugs.

            In the end I did my best and worked hard to make a functioning game to present for rest of the class, but I
            am not willing to finish this game as I see no future in this project. However, this project served a
            valuable lesson on how important it is to work as a team and communicate with each other. We also did
            deliver a functioning game that looks okay and plays well.
