            I will first explain the rules of Liar’s dice. It’s a game made popular by Pirates of the Caribbean and
            heavily involves game of bluffing. Each player has some amount of dices, and each player can only see their
            own dices. Players take turns bidding on how many of some dice value there is. Player can only call a bid
            that has a higher bid count or same bid count with higher dice value.
        </p>

        <p>
            Players can also call the previous player a liar. When this happens all the dices are revealed, and the dice
            total is counted. If the previous players bid was a lie, then the player calling the liar wins and gets to
            remove one die. The winner is the player who has no dices left. A extra rule that I have also implemented is
            that one’s are wild and count towards every die.

            Most Interesting part of this project was using socket IO to connect multiple clients to one server. I am
            not the most experienced with JavaScript which made this project challenging, but our course had a fantastic
            teacher, and JavaScript is not the hardest language.

            In addition to Unity and JavaScript I also utilized MySql to make a very simple database. During our first
            year of school, we made a flight map game that frequently used a database, so I had a decent amount of
            experience in handling a database. In that project the database was complex but in this project the database
            was simple and just stored some data about the winner.

            Overall, this project was a great learning opportunity on how to use multiple different techniques.
