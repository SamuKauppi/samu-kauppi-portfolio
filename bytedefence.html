                I began developing Byte Defence in spring of 2023 on Unity when one of my friends gave me the idea to
                develop a tower defence game.
                I worked on it mostly during classes and breaks while studying at Metropolia. I then took a break from
                it because the studies became
                more intensive, and I didn’t have enough free time to work on it.
            </p>

            <p>
                After selecting game studies as my major, I had a hard time coming up with a game that I wanted to do.
                Eventually, I decided to continue
                my old tower defence project that I had dropped. During spring, I coded the game very sloppily, and as I
                was revisiting it, I had to spend
                much more time in refactoring and optimizing than I had anticipated. At the start, I had planned a lot
                of unique gameplay elements, like
                abilities and environmental hazards, but ended up dropping most of them due to being forced to spend so
                much time on refactoring.

                I was also surprised on how much time I had to spend on playtesting.
                Tower defence games are slow by their nature, and they have a lot of different strategies attached to
                them,
                making playtesting hard and time consuming.
                Luckily, I had many helpful playtesters that happily played and gave valuable feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                I created virtually every asset in this game, handling everything from coding to crafting sprites.
                I'm thrilled with the outcome, both in terms of aesthetics and gameplay.
                However, I never want to create or even touch Unity Ui elements ever again.
                Coding and designing Ui in Unity is horrible.
                Despite of that, during this project I grew to have more appreciation for 2D art. It’s fun!

                I released the final version (hopefully) 12th of December 2023. I learned a lot during this project
                about coding and game design.
