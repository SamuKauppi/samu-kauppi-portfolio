        <p>
            I began developing Byte Defence in spring of 2023 on Unity when one of my friends gave me the idea to
            develop a tower defence game.
            I worked on it mostly during classes and breaks while studying at Metropolia. I then took a break from
            it because the studies became
            more intensive, and I didn’t have enough free time to work on it.
        </p>

        <p>
            After selecting game studies as my major, I had a hard time coming up with a game that I wanted to do.
            Eventually, I decided to continue
            my old tower defence project that I had dropped. During spring, I coded the game very sloppily, and as I
            was revisiting it, I had to spend
            much more time in refactoring and optimizing than I had anticipated. At the start, I had planned a lot
            of unique gameplay elements, like
            abilities and environmental hazards, but ended up dropping most of them due to being forced to spend so
            much time on refactoring.

            I was also surprised on how much time I had to spend on playtesting.
            Tower defence games are slow by their nature, and they have a lot of different strategies attached to
            them,
            making playtesting hard and time consuming.
            Luckily, I had many helpful playtesters that happily played and gave valuable feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
            I created virtually every asset in this game, handling everything from coding to crafting sprites.
            I'm thrilled with the outcome, both in terms of aesthetics and gameplay.
            However, I never want to create or even touch Unity Ui elements ever again.
            Coding and designing Ui in Unity is horrible.
            Despite of that, during this project I grew to have more appreciation for 2D art. It’s fun!

            I released the final version (hopefully) 12th of December 2023. I learned a lot during this project
            about coding and game design. You can play the game at
