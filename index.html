        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Samu Kauppi, and I am 26-year-old Finnish student with extensive experience in coding and with 2D/3D-graphics. Over the 4 years that I have been coding, I have worked on multiple personal projects from which I have gathered a lot of knowledge. Outside of personal projects, I have also worked for Niemikotisäätiö as apprenticeship trainee. For them I created a 3D simulation of their workplace in Unity. Currently I study at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences.</p>
        <p>Since my childhood I have been interested in games and computers, making this career path natural for me. Outside of computer software my hobbies include swimming and going outdoors with my dog. During winters I often go skiing and spring/autumn are best time to go fishing. I also love travelling because they always end up being unforgettable trips. Some of the best trips I have experienced have been my skiing trip to Japan and my summer trip to Singapore.</p>
        <p>I am a hard worker, passionate and while I prefer working alone, I thrive in teamwork. I start proactively working on projects because I have a strong self-discipline and I am confident in my talents as a software developer. I have a sense of humour and I love meeting new people. Every time I meet a new person, I learn new things.</p>
