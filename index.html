            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Samu Kauppi, and I am 27-year-old Finnish student with
                extensive experience in coding and with 2D/3D-graphics. Over the 5 years that I have been coding, I have
                worked on multiple projects from which I have gathered various skills and lot of knowledge. In addition
                to my personal projects, I completed an apprenticeship at Niemikotisäätiö and earned my degree in
                Information and Communication Technologies from Business College Helsinki. My primary job for
                Niemikotisäätiö was to create a 3D simulation of their workplace in Unity. I also taught 3D modelling
                their clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                2019 I completed my conscript service for the Finnish army in Hamina army academy. There I worked as a
                virtual support person. The jobs entailed developing the Finnish army virtual battle space which is a
                mod for a game called Arma. I also taught other conscripts on how to work effectively in virtual space.
            </p>
            <p>
                After army I completed game studies at HEO. In HEO I learned lot of valuable game and graphic techniques
                that I utilize to this day. Game engines like Unity and Construct 3, as well as image editing tools like
                Photoshop, GIMP, and Clip Studio Paint, are examples.
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently I study at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. I started my studies in 2022, and I have
                improved in coding a lot since then. Both learning new languages like Python, JavaScript and C++ and
                improving a lot with Unity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since my childhood I have been interested in games and computers, making this career path natural for
                me. Outside of computer software my hobbies include swimming and going outdoors. I often go skiing
                during winter, while spring and autumn are the best times for fishing. I also love travelling because
                they always end up being unforgettable trips. Some of the best trips I have experienced have been my
                skiing trip to Japan and my summer trip to Singapore. I also enjoy playing board games with my friends.
                Currently I am obsessed by Yu-Gi-Oh and Riichi Mahjong.
            </p>

                I am a hard worker, passionate and I excel working alone, but also thrive in teamwork. I start
                proactively working on projects because I have a strong self-discipline and I am confident in my talents
                as a software developer. I have a sense of humour and I love meeting new people. Every time I meet a new
                person, I learn new things.
