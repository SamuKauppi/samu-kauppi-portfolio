        <p>
            Flight game was the first group Python game project that we created while studying at Metropolia and thus
            the code was a bit rough, but I am still happy how it turned out. We worked on this project in two separate
            periods. First period focused on working with python and its commination with MySQL database. The second
            period focused on web design with Html, CSS and JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
            The way this game works is by focusing on communication between backend Python and frontend JavaScript. User
            inputs are sent from JavaScript to Python Server that handles it. Python has access to a MySQL database and
            fetches data from there. Our teachers provided data from every airport in the world for the data. Python
            backend handles the data and sends it to JavaScript that displays the game. This game has you travel around
            the world and the goal is to visit every continent with minimal gas consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a first group project this worked out well and was great learning opportunity to various aspects of
            software development.
